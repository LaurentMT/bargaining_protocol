# The Bargaining Protocol

The Bargaining Protocol aims to transpose a trade model based on prices negotiation into the cryptocurrencies world.

The protocol provides:
- provable negotiations: messages form a chain of signatures which ensures that the terms of the negotiation can't be forged
- trust-free negotiations: at every step, the seller is assured that the buyer owns the funds to cover the pledge

It takes inspiration in the Monotonic Concession Protocol from Games Theory (with some modifications: proposals are not simultaneous but sequential, more permissive stop conditions, ...) and is a generalization of the Payment Protocol (BIP70)
